# Vaccine Slot Availability

## Description
Discord Bot that notifies you when vaccination slots are available for a particular district. It checks for slots **every minute**. If a slot is available it will send a message on a Discord channel, every minute until the slots are available. If a slot is not available, it will not send any message. It is useful because it can notify more than one person at a time, added to that particular server.

## Prerequisites
You need to have a Discord Server where you will add this bot and permit it to send a message in the channel.
Clone the repository and add environment variables in your .env file.
